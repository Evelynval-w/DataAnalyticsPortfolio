### 1. Credit Risk Assessment Model
**Predicting loan defaults using Lending Club data**

Built a classification model to predict which borrowers are likely to default on their loans. This helps financial institutions make better lending decisions and reduce portfolio risk.

- **Dataset**: 250,000 loans from Lending Club (2007-2018)
- **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Key Metrics**: ROC-AUC, Expected Loss calculation
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Plotly
